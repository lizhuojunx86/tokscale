//! Antigravity subscription quota.
//!
//! Unlike every other provider here, this one never reaches a cloud API. The
//! Antigravity CLI (`agy`) and IDE both run a language server that holds the
//! OAuth token, calls Google Code Assist, caches the answer, and exposes it
//! over a loopback Connect-RPC endpoint. `/usage` inside the CLI reads exactly
//! that:
//!
//! ```text
//! POST http://127.0.0.1:<port>/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/RetrieveUserQuotaSummary
//! Connect-Protocol-Version: 1
//! {}
//! ```
//!
//! No CSRF token is required for this method, and tokscale never has to hold
//! an Antigravity credential of its own — the token stays inside the language
//! server and we only read the numbers it already computed.
//!
//! Calling Google's `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota`
//! directly was tried first and rejected: authentication succeeds, but a
//! `GEMINI_CLI` client identity is answered with `UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT` /
//! `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED` now that individual users have been migrated to
//! Antigravity.
//!
//! Antigravity meters quota **per model group** — Gemini models share one
//! weekly and one five-hour limit, Claude and GPT models share another — so
//! this provider emits one [`UsageOutput`] per group and names the group in
//! the account label. That reuses the existing multi-output path (the same one
//! Codex uses for multiple accounts) and renders as
//! `Antigravity (Gemini Models)`, rather than flattening every bucket into one
//! list where no row can be attributed to a group.
